### Priorities / To Do List

1. User creation and sign in authentication (with password).

2. User authorization.

3. Capture mood data (rating, reason and narrative) into DB.

4. Ensure mood data is only captured once per day. All data points may be modified but only most recent entry on that day will be kept. I.e. only 1 rating and reason. However, total narrative can be stored and retrieved.

5. Ability for user to see and search own mood data history.

6. Add graph/charts to user history?

7. CSS styling

8. Add compare functionality: generate user snapshot and target snapshot.
