<!-- This is misleading because the sum method is being called and in order to plot the daily rating, it is adding the rating and plotting that value. This could be an issue if a user posts multiple ratings for one day. I.e. if user posts 10 times that his mood was 1, it will add to a 10 which would be the same if he posted once as a 10 -->
